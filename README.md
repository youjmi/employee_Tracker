 ## Description

 Welcome! I would like to present to you my Employee Tracker!

 Here is my link : https://github.com/youjmi/employee_Tracker


 Here is the link to my video tutorial: ---------------


In this homework assignment, I have created and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation 

Please install the following

```
npm i inquirer --save
```

The Inquirer will prompt inputs in your terminal.

Then application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node server.js
```

## Usage
Once that is invoked, the user's terminal will proceed with a large menu with several options that will help you navigate you through the Employee Tracker application. In this application, not only will you be able to view the basics such as: 

  * Adding departments, roles, employees

  * Viewing departments, roles, employees

  * Updating employee roles

BUT ALSO :

  * Updating employee managers

  * Viewing employees by manager

  * Deleting departments, roles, and employees

  * Viewing the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
